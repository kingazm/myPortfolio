# Welcome to my little digital business card!

This app is to showcase my brand in a shorter form than a resume. Looks good both on a computer and a mobile device, thanks to a responsive layout (see separate build files for wider and narrower devices). Utilizes custom widgets tailored to the project.
In the 'Projects' section click on miniatures to view description and buttons to proceed to my repositories. Click the envelope icon to send me an email. Click the Github or LinkedIn icons to see my profile on those respective platforms.
